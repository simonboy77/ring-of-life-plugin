# Survival Chance
A plugin that calculates your odds of survival after X turns of combat



Caveats:
- Turning the plugin on mid-combat will not yet register your current opponent(s)
- When fighting multiple opponents, the attack speed of the hardest hitting one will be used to decide
how many attacks from the others you will take in your selected turn amount
- When a monster has multiple attack styles and you are using a protection prayer, what then?
